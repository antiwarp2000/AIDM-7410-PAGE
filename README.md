Webpage for AIDM-7410 computational journalism's presentation.


This repository was created in the Semester 2 of 2022-2023. It stores the group project of the course AIDM-7410 Computational Journalism @ Hong Kong Baptist University, School of Communication (HKBU). This group project was created by JIANG Zhuohao, YU Minghao,and HE Yuchen.


We have utilized AI techniques/models and visualization components to create a data-driven news work focused on the World Press Photo (WPP) contest.

Specifically, we have collected and analyzed 2,880 entries and over 12,800 photos from all WPP awards since 1955, along with examination on descriptions of these award-winning photos and information about the photographers published on the official WPP website.

Our goal was to identify trends and characteristics of WPP awards both externally and internally, strive to demonstrate the overall criteria and taste of WPP awards (and their trends), and ultimately tend to acquire the answer and a guidance for you who are interested: <br><b>WHAT MAKES A PRIZE IN World Press Photo CONTESTS?</b>
